# Outdated version!

See the new version [here](https://github.com/OtavioCantareli/trybe-solar-system).

## Ladies and gents, welcome!

This is the project I did @ Trybe. It was the first project using React and served as an introduction to the lib.
<br>
I only made what's inside ./components. All the rest was already set up.
<br>
I didn't add any style because I hate CSS hehe.
